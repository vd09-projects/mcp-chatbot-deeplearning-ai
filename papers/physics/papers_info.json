    "summary": "In this paper, it is argued that theoretical physics is more akin to an\norganism than to a rigid structure.It is in this sense that the epithet,\n\"sick\", applies to it. It is argued that classical physics is a model of a\nhealthy science, and the degree of sickness of modern physics is measured\naccordingly. The malady is located in the relationship between mathematics and\nphysical meaning in physical theory.",
